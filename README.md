* Comparison Metrics:

* Good months are those where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year.
* Bad months are the opposite, where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year.
* The best month is where the profit after tax was the maximum for the year.
* The worst month is where the profit after tax was the minimum for the year.

## Conclusion:

Revenue and expenses fluctuate monthly, impacting profit and profit after tax.
Good months indicate stronger performance compared to the average, while bad months suggest weaker performance.

Identifying the best and worst months provides insights into the peaks and troughs of financial performance.

Analyzing profit margins helps understand the efficiency of converting revenue into profit after tax.

It's essential to manage expenses effectively to maximize profits and ensure consistent performance throughout the year.
